## Sample MCP Client

Small Node client that boots the MCP server via stdio and exercises all tools.

### Run
```bash
cd mcp-server && npm install && npm run build
cd ../clients/sample-client && npm install && npm run build && npm start
```

Expected output shows index size, search results, a preview summary, install suggestion, and rate limit.
